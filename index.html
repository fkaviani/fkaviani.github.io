	abstract = {Approaches to trance and possession in anthropology have tended to use outmoded models drawn from psychodynamic theory or treated such dissociative phenomena as purely discursive processes of attributing action and experience to agencies other than the self. Within psychology and psychiatry, understanding of dissociative disorders has been hindered by polemical ‘‘either/or’’ arguments: either dissociative disorders are real, spontaneous alterations in brain states that reﬂect basic neurobiological phenomena, or they are imaginary, socially constructed role performances dictated by interpersonal expectations, power dynamics and cultural scripts. In this paper, we outline an approach to dissociative phenomena, including trance, possession and spiritual and healing practices, that integrates the neuropsychological notions of underlying mechanism with sociocultural processes of the narrative construction and social presentation of the self. This integrative model, grounded in a cultural neuroscience, can advance ethnographic studies of dissociation and inform clinical approaches to dissociation through careful consideration of the impact of social context.},

How does understanding the biology of religious experience inform the ongoing reconstruction of religious rituals and myths? In The Mystical Mind, Eugene d’Aquili and Andrew Newberg address these central questions and others from a distinct perspective called biogenetic structuralism. They propose a model of how brain activity gives rise to mystical experiential states, examine how neurobiological responses to rhythmic behavior form religious ritual, and point toward the development of a megatheology, or a theological system appealing to the widest scope of religious worldviews. This paper is a critical review of d’Aquili and Newberg’s exciting work.},

In most scholarly studies of ritual, analyses of the material setting are avoided in favour of a focus on symbolic expression, cultural representations, or embodied cognition. Here a close look at the interplay between substances, sounds, smells, elementary actions on matter and supernatural forces shows that there is a blending phenomenon between myth, rite and technique at the early stages of the preparatory phases as well as during the ritual action itself. The central part played by technical actions and interaction with matter in the ritual of Samoan tattooing is a case study for a technological approach to ritual efficacy.},

Recognizing that such acts can have an initiatory function, sociological, anthropological and psychoanalytic views of initiation and the role of the father in masculine development are examined. In some boys oedipal development is forestalled and castration anxiety is not experienced. A bifocal approach using object relations theories based on regression and Lacanian perspectives that highlight reactions to an oedipal impasse is used to understand these processes. Symbolic body modiﬁcations are differentiated from those that are non-symbolic.},

	abstract = {Theories of pain have traditionally been dominated by biomedicine and concentrate upon its neurophysiological aspects, both in diagnosis and treatment. Hence, scientific medicine reduces the experience of pain to an elaborate broadcasting system of signals, rather than seeing it as moulded and shaped both by the individual and their particular socio-cultural context. Although pain lies at the intersection between biology and culture, naaking it an obvious topic for sociological investigation, scant attention has been paid to understanding beliefs about pain within the study of health and Ulness. A major impediment to a more adequate conceptualisation of pain is due to the manner in which it has been 'medicalised', resulting in the inevitable Cartesian split between body and mind. Consequently, the dominant conceptualisation of pain has focused upon sensation, with the subsequent inference that it is able to be rationally and objectively measured. Yet as well as being a medical 'problem', pain is an everyday experience. Moreover, sociological and phenomenological approaches to pain would add to, and enhance, existing bodies of knowledge and help to reclaim pain from the dominant scientific paradigm. In this paper, it is argued, firstly, that the elevation of sensation over emotion within medico-psychological approaches to pain{\textasciicircum}can be shown to be limiting and reductionist. Secondly, we attempt to show how insights from the newly-emerging sociological arenas of emotions and embodiment provide a framework which is able to both transcend the divide between mind and body and to develop a phenomenoiogical approach to pain. Finally, in order to bring the meaning of pain into fuller focus, we draw attention to the importance of studying theodices and narratives, as well as the cultural shaping and patterning of beliefs and responses to pain.},

By focusing on the unit of analysis, this paper demonstrates that little is actually known about the process of tattooing. This review highlights how research on the subject is concentrated on understanding tattoo wearers. Existing literature on tattooing can be summarized into one of four general themes or sets of ﬁndings: tattooed individuals, group behavior, art or cultural production, and commoditization of culture. While viewed as a trivial subject, research indicates that tattooing is highly complex and social behavior. I propose that research shift from tattoos as the outcome cultural production to the social processes and conditions under which they are produced. While we know a lot about tattoo wearers, research on the process of tattooing can inform larger sociological debates, including discussions of labor, commodiﬁcation, art, authenticity, and marginality.},

However, a study by Swami and Furnham (2007) showed that tattooed women were rated as less physically attractive but more sexually promiscuous. Given that men interpret women’s sexual intent according to their physical appearance, we predicted that women with tattoos would be more favorably approached by men. A temporary tattoo was placed on confederates’ lower back, or not, and all confederates were instructed to read abookwhile lying ﬂat ontheirstomach on a well-known beach. Two experiments were conducted. The ﬁrst experiment showed that more men (N = 220) approached the tattooed confederates and that the mean latency of their approach was quicker. A second experiment showed that men (N = 440) estimated to have more chances to have a date and to have sex onthe ﬁrst date with tattooed confederates. However, thelevel of physical attractiveness attributed to the confederate was not inﬂuenced by the tattoo condition. These results were discussed with respect to men’s possible misinterpretation of women wearing tattoos and the risks associated with this misinterpretation.},

Challenging postmodernist-spirited lifestyle consumption theory that asserts the breakdown of stratiﬁcation systems through consumer habits, the article delineates how three important ‘symbolic neighborhoods of lower class masculinity’ – muscles, motorcycles, and tattoos – have been transformed from lower- to middle-class distinction. Framing these recent changes as investment, invasion, transformation and displacement, the article illustrates how apparent tolerance and ﬂuidity among consumer lifestyles is less reﬂective of the obliteration of stratiﬁcation systems than a new strategic means of reconstructing them. Particular attention is focused on Bourdieu’s multi-faceted conceptualization of ‘cultural capital’ and the victorious application of ‘aesthetic disposition’.},

	abstract = {Are we witnessing the democratisation of body modification in Australia? The prevalence and social background of body modifications is examined using national and state-level survey data from Australia. We find body modifications to be more prevalent among younger, less educated, working-class, non-conservative Australians. Women are far more likely than men are to have body piercings, although in Queensland, young women are more likely than young men to be tattooed. Important life events such as pregnancy, separating from a long-term partner or experiencing violence are also associated with body modifications. While body modifications may be on the rise, social factors still influence the uptake of body modification practices in Australia, suggesting these are socially circumscribed taste-based practices, and should not yet be described as normative.},

	abstract = {Theorized as a Bourdieusian field, this article examines changes inside the tattoo world resulting in the valuation of certain tattoo practices as art and some actors taking ‘fine art’ positions within it. The category of tattoo art is distinct from tattoo because it positions the practice away from its traditional historic moorings as a lowbrow craft and occupation requiring a rudimentary level of technical skill. In contrast, tattoo art is created and evaluated within academic discourses and traditional fine art ideologies that stress innovation, creativity, and exclusivity. In addition to mastery of the medium, that is, applying the tattoo to skin, tattoo artists create original works that qualify as artistic by art world conventions. This process of artification has changed the symbolic meanings and valuation of a practice, imbuing tattoo art with cultural legitimacy from the inside.},

	abstract = {Background: We have seen a number of individuals who received blood-type tattoos on the left side of the chest as schoolchildren in northwest Indiana during the 1950s.
Objective: To investigate the history of blood-type tattooing.
Methods: Historical research was conducted using newspaper and journal articles found in medical libraries, online archives, American Medical Association archives, Chicago Historical Society records, local medical society documents, in addition to personal interviews.
Results: Blood-type tattoos were used during the Cold War to enable rapid transfusions as part of a ‘‘walking blood bank’’ in case of atomic attack. Nationwide blood-typing programs occurred to inform individuals of their own blood types and to provide local communities with lists of possible donors. The blood-type tattooing program was part of this effort, but community-wide tattooing occurred only in two parts of the United States: Lake County, Indiana, and Cache and Rich counties, Utah. In these communities, during 1951 and 1952, schoolchildren were tattooed to facilitate emergency transfusions. Limitations: Events occurred more than 50 years ago, so we relied on original documents and interviews from individuals involved in the program who are still alive.
Conclusions: The use of blood-type tattoos was short lived, lasting less than a year, and ultimately failed because physicians did not trust tattoos for medical information. ( J Am Acad Dermatol 2008;58:472-6.)},

	abstract = {Tattooing the skin as a means of personal expression is a ritualized practice that has been around for centuries across many different cultures. Accordingly, the symbolic meaning of tattoos has evolved over time and is highly individualized, from both the internal perspective of the wearer and the external perspective of an observer. Within modern Western societies through the 1970s, tattoos represented a cultural taboo, typically associated with those outside of the mainstream such as soldiers, incarcerated criminals, gang members, and others belonging to marginalized and counter-cultural groups. This paper aims to review the more recent epidemiology of tattoos in Western culture in order to establish that tattooing has become a mainstream phenomenon. We then review psychological and psychiatric aspects of tattoos, with a goal of revising outmoded stigmas about tattooing and helping clinicians working with tattooed patients to facilitate an exploration of the personal meaning of skin art and self-identity. We suggest that as a kind of augmentation of the physical exam, looking at and talking to patients about their tattoos can provide a valuable window into the psyche, informing clinical practice.},

Half of the participants viewed a target with a tattoo, and half viewed that target without it, allowing for both within- (participants all rated one male and one female target with a tattoo and another without) and between-participants (participants rated either the tattooed or non-tattooed version of a single target) comparisons. Tattooed targets, especially women, were rated as stronger and more independent, but were rated more negatively on other character attributes than the same target images with the tattoos removed. The stigma associated with tattoos appears to still exist, despite the prevalence of tattoos in modern culture.},

	abstract = {This theoretical article considers the potential for a revival of sociological interest in online embodiment by developing a conceptual alternative to the predominant framework of self-presentation, and showing how social theory may benefit from exploration of this field. It starts by critically reviewing the discussion on online embodiment, pointing out its theoretical shortcomings, and arguing that they result from the difficulty that social theory has with accounting for the increased ontological complexity of embodiment induced by the pervasiveness of digital technologies. Treating a theory of practice as an inspiring perspective, it then adapts the notion of translation as a general term capable of grasping the complex relationships between physical bodies, digital technologies, reflexive selves and the social aspects of online embodiment. An important advantage of this concept is that it makes it possible to see the role of technology as constitutive without losing the sociological perspective, and encompasses a wide range of contemporary body-technology interactions. Furthermore, it also has the potential to foster a sociological understanding of the relationships between bodily, technological, mindful and social elements, and to do so without slipping into reductionism.},

This is shown to be the case for the tattoo and tattooing. The tattoo is conceived as a medium of communication through which different forms of communication emerge. Tattooing is one of these forms of communication that shapes the medium in a particular way. The current article sheds a special light on its intricate, communicational constellation, for which the concept of parallax is suggested. Law, medicine and cosmetics as other forms of communication use the medium of tattoo in their own way as well. The form/medium distinction allows us to grasp these different forms of communication, while it shows that they share the tattoo as medium. The article’s ultimate goal is to illustrate that the tattoo figures as a multifaceted medium of communication.},

	abstract = {This article seeks to offer a critical assessment of the conception of ethics underlying the growing constellation of ‘new materialist’ social theories. It argues that such theories offer little if any purchase in understanding the contemporary transformations of relations between mind and body or human and non-human natures. Taking as exemplary the work of Jane Bennett, Rosi Braidotti, and Karen Barad, this article asserts that a continuity between ethics and ontology is central to recent theories of ‘materiality’. These theories assert the primacy of matter by calling upon a spiritual or ascetic self-transformation so that one might be ‘attuned to’ or ‘register’ materiality and, conversely, portray critique as hubristic, conceited, or resentful, blinded by its anthropocentrism. It is argued that framing the grounds for ontological speculation in these ethical terms licences the omission of analysis of social forces mediating thought’s access to the world and so grants the theorist leave to sidestep any questions over the conditions of thought. In particular, the essay points to ongoing processes of the so-called primitive accumulation as constituting the relationship between mind and body, human and non-human natures.},

Tattooing is a practice long associated with social outsiders - sailors, criminals, bikers and women of disrepute. In recent years, however, the practice has become increasingly popular, and acceptable, in mainstream culture as these marks of distinction appear on an ever greater number of bodies. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork, academic literature, and content analysis of popular media, I propose that four inter-related developments have contributed to the redefinition of tattooing: the increasing importance of the body as a site for constructing identity; processes of cultural diversity and globalization; the increased visibility of the practice in popular culture; and attempts to legitimise the practice as an acceptable art form both within academia and popular culture. By drawing together these inter-related developments this paper demonstrates how Elias' theories of establishedoutsider relations provides an understanding of the processes that lead to changing statuses for certain cultural practices.},

	abstract = {Purpose: There have been a number of prior studies that have investigated the relationship between tattoos and crime with most documenting evidence of an association. Speciﬁcally, prior research often suggests that individuals with tattoos commit more crime, are disproportionately concentrated in offender and institutionalized populations, and often have personality disorders. Having said this, the bulk of the prior research on this topic has been correlational.
Methods: In the current study, we rely on data from a prospective longitudinal study of 411 British males from the Cambridge Study in Delinquent Development and employ propensity score matching to determine if the link between tattoos and crime may in fact be causal.
Results: Results suggest that having tattoos is better considered as a symptom of another set of developmental risk factors and personality traits that are both related to tattooing and being involved in crime rather than as a causal factor for predicting crime over the life-course.
Conclusions: Study limitations and directions for future research are discussed. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Essentialist, romantic stereotypes detract from deep understanding of Indigenous Australians, and negotiated solutions are not really possible when the parties involved are in grossly unequal circumstances. Scholarship acknowledges diversity within Indigenous groups and the New Age movement as well as convergences and reciprocal cultural borrowing, often within romantic epistemologies. A simple dichotomy of cultural theft by New Age practitioners from Indigenous Australians is inadequate to explain the complexities of the interaction.},

The problem of suffering, as it is often called, has been a compelling reason for abandoning faith. Given the depth of the dilemma that raw and inexplicable pain poses, it is surprising how pervasive voluntary pain has been among the religions of the world. Ascetics, mystics, and martyrs have sought and applied pain—in rites of passage (ordeals) and other forms of initiation—in the service of religious inquisitions (including trials by ordeal), execution of heretics and witches, and others. And of course, none of these has been limited by geographic location or historic time. What is the role of voluntary (“sacred”) pain in human religious life? Is there a single theory that can explain, for instance, the initiatory ordeals of new shamans and Sufi mystics?},

              involves the presence of the narrator, Encolpius, his lover Giton, and the rogue-poet Eumolpus, on board a ship owned by Lichas, of which another passenger is the flighty matron, Tryphaena. In an earlier episode of the novel, Lichas seems to have been the lover of Encolpius and Tryphaena of Giton, though both affairs had ended in enmity. There ensues a comic deliberation between Encolpius and Giton about ways of escape. One of them involves the ink which Eumolpus has brought aboard as a man of literature. Encolpius suggests that he and Giton dye themselves with it from head to foot and pretend to be Eumolpus' Ethiopian (that is, African) slaves. Giton contemptuously dismisses the idea, and proposes suicide. Eumolpus intervenes with what he considers a better idea. His manservant, who is a barber, will shave the heads and eyebrows of Encolpius and Giton, and then he himself 'will mark your faces with an elaborate inscription to give the impression that you have been punished with a mark. That way the same letters will both allay the suspicions of your pursuers and hide your faces with the appearance of punishment' ('sequar ego frontes notans inscriptione sollerti, ut uideamini stigmate esse puniti. ita eaedem litterae et suspicionem declinabunt quaerentium et uultus umbra supplicii tegent'). This is agreed to, and 'Eumolpus filled the foreheads of us both with huge letters, and with generous hand covered our whole faces with the wellknown inscription of runaway slaves' ('impleuit Eumolpus frontes utriusque ingentibus litteris et notum fugitiuorum epigramma per totam faciem liberali manu duxit').},

(2) What changes in self perception did women attribute to their being tattooed? (3) What changes in behavior did women attribute to their being tattooed? In-depth interviews of thirty tattooed women served as our data. Tattoos held several meanings for participants including connection to self, life events, relationships, and spirituality.

Classical sociology paid attention to the body but did not develop a sociology of the body per se.

Postmodern conditions created a situation where individuality is thought to be maintained by and through the public presentation of the body, and in hypermodernity the ‘virtual body’ was made possible by the spread of digital technology.},

	abstract = {What makes a face attractive and why do we have the preferences we do? Emergence of preferences early in development and cross-cultural agreement on attractiveness challenge a long-held view that our preferences reflect arbitrary standards of beauty set by cultures. Averageness, symmetry, and sexual dimorphism are good candidates for biologically based standards of beauty. A critical review and meta-analyses indicate that all three are attractive in both male and female faces and across cultures. Theorists have proposed that face preferences may be adaptations for mate choice because attractive traits signal important aspects of mate quality, such as health. Others have argued that they may simply be by-products of the way brains process information. Although often presented as alternatives, I argue that both kinds of selection pressures may have shaped our perceptions of facial beauty.},

What do contemporary sociological approaches contribute to our understanding of corporeality and embodiment? What kind of changes does this represent in relation to classical perspectives? How do different theoretical approaches connect to contemporary interests and empirical research? The present article attempts to answer these questions, looking at the development and diversification of sociological approaches to the body, from Elias and Bourdieu to contemporary feminist, Foucauldian post-structuralism and queer theories. The authors highlight current research that is intersectional, international and path-breaking. They also pay particular attention to connections between the social, cultural and the political, as expressed in and through bodies, and point to the unresolved nature of the relationship between narrative, discourse and the materiality of the body.},

Queer people have used a vast array of body alterations to articulate queer desire or identity. This paper directs attention to the racialised dimension of queer practices of body modification. The prevalence of neo-primitivist aesthetics and ideologies and the allure of racial cross-identification in a predominantly white culture of sexual dissidents call into question the claims of the ‘subversive’ character of queer body modification practices. In contradistinction, the lack of engagement with the legacies of colonial representation results in the persistence of epistemic violence. The grand theories of gender and sexual transgression on the level of queer theory, too, work through and around a discursive racialisation of signs, bodies, and identities. Yet the investment in a racialised language of desire and the uneven positions of power across which it is articulated are usually disavowed by white queer theorists. Queer strategies of transgression lack a sufficiently complex analysis of power which obscures their own collusion in certain forms of oppression.},

Motivations for such physically intense activities include religious devotion, sensation-seeking and social bonding. The present study aims to explore an extreme ritual within the context of bondage/discipline, dominance/submission and sadism/masochism (BDSM): the ‘Dance of Souls’, a 160-person ritual involving temporary piercings with weights or hooks attached and dancing to music provided by drummers. Through hormonal assays, behavioural observations and questionnaires administered before, during and after the Dance, we examine the physiological and psychological effects of the Dance, and the themes of spirituality, connectedness, transformation, release and community reported by dancers. From before to during the Dance, participants showed increases in physiological stress (measured by the hormone cortisol), self-reported sexual arousal, self-other overlap and decreases in psychological stress and negative affect. Results suggest that this group of BDSM practitioners engage in the Dance for a variety of reasons, including experiencing spirituality, deepening interpersonal connections, reducing stress and achieving altered states of consciousness.},

The three primary goals are to: (1) lay out conventional definitions of [deviant]3 leisure; (2) outline qualities of BDSM consistent with serious leisure in order to problematize [deviant] leisure; and (3) discuss the implications of this analysis and recommend future directions for research.},

Spiritual tattoos work through an inside-out/outside-in mechanism. The process of tattooing draws abstract or overwhelming interior elements (thoughts, emotions, memories) out and materializes them through the infliction of pain. At the same time, things of desire outside the self (spiritual ideals, healing symbols, conceptions of a new self) are conveyed into the body through the process of painful inscription. Through the pain of tattooing and the marks left in the skin, abstractions are made concrete and real, shaping identity, memory, and spirituality.},

An intersectional, sociomaterial approach is needed to grasp the implications of neuroscientific research that aims to both produce and repair neurobiological difference. Following Benjamin?s critique of the ?carceral imagination? of technoscience, this article considers how such research may fix in terms of helping, or in contrast, fix by classifying and reifying, vulnerable subjects. I address the potential for biosocial determinism in linking neural phenotypes and social problems. I use an intersectional approach to consider the presence and absence of race in this body of research and explore how some methodological and conceptual framings of the ?brain on poverty? mark poor and minority children for intervention in concert with neoliberal approaches to poverty.},

In juxtaposition, and immanent, are multiple requirements for the self to be harmed, in various ways, for the purposes of achieving organizational progress. This post‐structuralist composition explores how these requirements are inscribed, and desired, in different ways during ontotheological and neo‐primitive processes of sacrifice, neomasochism, simulacra, exclusion, and theodicy. These processes permit the possibility that the harming of the self can be justified (utility/include) and also discounted (diminish/exclude). It is argued, that relations of self and harm constantly arise, and change, during non‐integratable affects and events of radical alteration; namely where self questioning (loss of self) and questioning of self (identity) occur. However, it is argued, neo‐primitive organizing constantly refuses ethical responsiveness to self harm, through the inscriptive superimposition of exchange relations of lack, debt and guilt.},

	abstract = {Based on a five-year qualitative ethnographic study of Bondage and Discipline/Dominance and Submission/Sadism and Masochism (BDSM) in Sweden, this paper examines the process of becoming among BDSM practitioners. In-depth interviews were completed with 29 self-defined BDSM practitioners, and their accounts were analysed using thematic analysis. Focusing on the Deleuzian concept of becoming, BDSM is understood as a dynamic and collective phenomenon closely connected to fantasies, memories and longing, and enabled through flows of desire. Practising BDSM can be understood as a process of increasing expansion, creation and connection, in which desire is seen not as something we lack or need but rather as a process of striving and self-enhancement. Exploring the becoming process more fully can provide a better understanding as to why some people choose to practise BDSM.},

	abstract = {Past research has observed that extreme rituals and BDSM activities have the ability to produce altered states of consciousness.  Currently it is unknown what role inducing or receiving painful stimuli may have in eliciting these responses.  22 participants (5 tattoo artists, 11 clients, and 6 observers) were recruited at a local tattoo parlor.  Tattoo artists were expected to enter into a state of flow (Csikszentmihalyi \& Csikszentmihalyi, 1988) as measured by the SHORT Flow State Scale while any altered state of consciousness found in clients was expected to be accounted for by Dietrich’s (2003) transient hypofrontality hypothesis (measured with a Stroop task via tablet).  No evidence was found that participants entered into a state of flow or transient hypofrontality.  Participants did show a reduction in positive affect as well as a trending reduction in negative affect.  Tattoo artists and clients reported feeling closer to each other; other groups (e.g. artists and observers) had no significant changes in closeness.  Ego depletion, as measured by a handgrip task, may have occurred although the small sample size, as well as hand fatigue in the tattoo artists after the tattoo procedure, may better account for this finding.},

Building upon recent attempts to address this situation, I develop a transactional approach towards body pedagogics that explores how the shifting borders governing human?animal relations influence people?s embodied identities. Transactions between humans and (other) animals have been an historic constant across contrasting societies, but the patterning of these exchanges is framed by specific cultural body pedagogics. Focusing on the institutional means, characteristic experiences and corporeal outcomes of ?civilising? and ?companionate? human?animal body pedagogics, I explore the identity-shaping impact of these different modalities of inter-species inter-corporeality and demonstrate the sociological utility of this transactional approach.},

	abstract = {Introduction. Body piercing and tattooing are accepted by a growing number of teenagers and young adults as a way of self-expressing. Some authors suggest association between body piercings/tattoos and early sexual initiation, higher number of sexual partners, or risky sexual behaviors. Aim. The aim of the study was to evaluate sexual behaviors among young adults with body modifications (BMs)—tattoos and piercings. Methods. One hundred twenty young healthy adults, ages between 20 and 35, were included in the population study. The study group was divided into three subgroups: controls (N = 60), adults with tattoos (N = 28), and adults with piercings (N = 32). The research instrument was a self-prepared questionnaire containing 59 questions assessing socioepidemiological parameters, sexual behaviors, incidents of sexual harassment in the past, and self-attractiveness evaluation, as well as questions concerning tattoos and piercings. Socioepidemiological variables and sexual behaviors were compared between subgroups. Main Outcome Measures. To assess and describe the correlation between having BM—tattoos and piercings—and sexual behaviors in the population of young adults by using the logistic regression model. Results. Adults with BMs have had their first intercourse statistically earlier and were more sexually active compared with controls. There were no statically significant differences in sexual orientation, sexual preferences, engaging in risky sexual behaviors, frequency of masturbation, and history of sexual abuse between the groups. In contrast, the frequency of sexual intercourses was statistically higher and oral sex was more likely to be a dominant sexual activity in adults with BM compared with controls. The multivariate logistic model revealed that adults with BM were four times less likely to participate in religious practices and twice more likely to have early sexual initiation. Conclusions. Having BM is associated with early sexual initiation and more liberal attitudes toward sexual behaviors but not with engaging in risky sexual behaviors.

This queerness, as an embodied erotics fed by durational—as opposed to impersonal and anonymous—ties, rides on the relational. That is, it is our fleshy entanglements and shared dependencies that enable these returns, returns that refuse and reconfigure lived trauma.

Participants with a history of sexual abuse and high users with more than 10 body modifications differed from those without these features with respect to several motivations and consequences of body modification.

Females are more likely than males to have a tattoo. Tattooed students are significantly more likely than non-tattooed students to engage in alcohol and marijuana use and risky sexual behaviors. Suicidal behaviors and suicidal ideation are not related to tattoo status among university students. Therefore, college health professionals should be aware of associations between tattooing and risky behavioral involvement.

The present study is a report of two cases describing squamous cell carcinoma associated with genital piercing. Methods. Case reports of two men admitted to an academic medical center. Results. A 60-year-old man with a history of HIV and hepatitis C as well as a Prince Albert piercing presented for treatment of a urethrocutaneous fistula. A biopsy of indurated granulation tissue surrounding the fistula revealed invasive, moderately-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. A 56-year-old man with a history of HIV, hepatitis C, and a Prince Albert piercing presented following a single episode of gross hematuria. He also reported splitting of his urinary stream. On physical examination, areas of necrosis were noted on the glans penis; biopsy revealed invasive, poorly-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Conclusions. The present study is the first to suggest a possible association between squamous cell carcinoma of the penis/urethra and genital piercing. Patients with genital piercings, especially those with concurrent risk factors such as HIV and HCV, should be counselled about this rare complication.

BDSM, and especially sadomasochism,? is difficult to understand in its own, characteristic motivational perspective because such negative experiences as, say, pain and humiliation, indicate aversion rather than attraction. To cause pain to others is typically condemned. To cosset pain and suffering is said to be perverse. My main point is we that can better understand BDSM via its typical language and rhetoric, especially by paying attention to the key role of linguistic metonymy when we discuss the riddles of pain and pleasure. Also, this article discusses the various ways of talking about and potentially condemning BDSM by calling it a perversion or a paraphilic disorder.

It builds on participant observation data with a population of middle-class tattooees and examines how individuals attempted to legitimate their tattoos during interactions with others. First-time tattooees in the 1990s are seen as agents caught between multiple symbolic orders—symbolic orders that generated conflicting images of tattoos. Relying on a set of legitimation techniques, middle-class tattooees worked to overcome the negative meanings associated with tattoos by getting body art that conformed to core mainstream norms and values. By examining the creation and use of these legitimation maneuvers, this article reveals the way in which definitions of deviance are negotiated in everyday contexts. In addition, the process of legitimation identified in this article points to one way in which everyday interactions can contribute to larger cultural shifts.},

	abstract = {Background: In recent years, increasing numbers of adults and adolescents have opted to undergo tattoo and piercing procedures. Studies among adolescents with tattoo and piercing have usually explored the relationship between one factor and the decision to have tattoos and/or piercings. The aim of this study was to determine relationships between body cosmetic procedures and selfesteem, propensity for sensation seeking, and risk behaviours among adults. Materials and Methods: The subjects were divided into two groups, i.e., those with (n=429) and those without tattoos/piercings (n=237), and self-esteem, propensity for sensation seeking, and risk behaviour were compared between the two groups using self-report questionnaires. To analyse differences in self-esteem and the propensity for sensation seeking, general characteristics were statistically adjusted. In addition, general characteristics, self-esteem, and propensity for sensation seeking were statistically adjusted to determine differences in the propensity for risk behaviour between the two groups. Results: Significant differences were observed in age, marital status, income level, occupation, values or sensitivity to fashion, and educational level between the group with and that without tattoos/ piercings. There was no significant difference in self-esteem, whereas there were significant differences in the propensity for sensation seeking and risk behaviour between the two groups. Conclusions: Continuous attention to, and interest in, the increased incidence of tattooing and piercing are necessary, especially in terms of public interventions for health education and health promotion, as these forms of self-adornment are associated with behaviours that pose a risk to health.},

Data collection strategies included snow-balling, social networks, personal contact, and visits to tattoo parlors. The main results indicate that the majority of women express satisfaction with their physical appearance after getting tattooed, and wouldn’t get the tattoo removed. Being tattooed correlated with risk behaviors such as casual sex with unknown people, alcohol and drug use, and psychopathology. The sample presented more similarities than differences between tattooed and non-tattooed groups, suggesting that growing popularization and social acceptance of tattooing has led to a decrease of the differences between the groups. Such results may inform future research and the production of informative materials aimed at demystifying negative stereotypes associated to tattoos.},

With the widespread adoption of tattoos in Western countries in recent years this negative association has been questioned. An issue which arises, however, is that “tattooing” is a heterogeneous activity that covers a wide spectrum of designs and motivations. To examine the characteristics of individuals presenting to medicolegal autopsy with “expletive tattoos” 19 individuals with tattoos that contained selected obscene words were compared to controls. Fifteen cases (79\%) were found where deaths were classified as unnatural – 7 drug/alcohol related, 5 suicides, 2 accidents and 1 homicide. The decedents had an age range of 21–58 years, mean 39.7 years, with a male to female ratio of 14:1. Compared to controls there was a significantly increased number of unnatural deaths in the group with expletive tattoos (p {\textless} 0.01), with a tendency to involve males. This study has shown that expletive tattoos in a forensic context may be associated with unnatural and violent deaths, and that the study of particular subgroups of tattooed individuals may be useful in discerning specific trends that are unclear if “tattoos” are treated as a homogeneous phenomenon.},

	abstract = {Background: According to previous studies, one of the common problems of everyday life of persons with tattoos is risky behavior. However, direct examination of the decision making process, as well as factors which determine women’s risk-taking decisions to get tattoos, have not been conducted. This study investigates whether risk taking decision-making is associated with the self-assessment impulsiveness in tattooed women.
Methods: Young women (aged 18–35 years) with (N = 60) and without (N = 60) tattoos, performed the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), as a measure of decision-making processes, as well as completing the Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS-11).
Results: Tattooed women showed significantly higher scores in the BIS-11 and preference for disadvantageous decks on the IGT compared to non-tattooed women. There was no significant correlation between risky decision-making in the IGT and BIS-11 impulsivity measures. A significantly higher rate of smoking was observed in the tattooed women. However, the analysis did not reveal a group effect after adjustment for smoking in the IGT and the BIS-11 measures.
Conclusions: The present study was specifically designed to resolve questions regarding associations between impulsiveness and risky decision-making in tattooed women. It shows that in tattooed women, risky decisions are not a direct result of their self-reported impulsiveness. Smoking does not explain the psychometric differences between tattooed women and controls.},

Having shown how eighteenth century political economy marks the birth of a new governmental reason, Foucault undertakes the detailed analysis of the forms of this liberal governmentality. This involves describing the political rationality within which the specific problems of life and population were posed: "Studying liberalism as the general framework of biopolitics."" "What are the specific features of the liberal art of government as they were outlined in the eighteenth century? What crisis of governmentality characterizes the present world and what revisions of liberal government has it given rise to? This is the diagnostic task addressed by Foucault's study of the two major twentieth century schools of neo-liberalism: German ordoliberalism and the neo-liberalism of the Chicago School. In the years he taught at the College de France, this was Michel Foucault's sole foray into the field of contemporary history. This course raises questions of political philosophy and social policy that are at the heart of current debates about the role and status of neo-liberalism in twentieth century politics. A remarkable feature of these lectures is their discussion of contemporary economic theory and practice, culminating in an analysis of the model of homo oeconomicus, or economic man." "Foucault's analysis also highlights the paradoxical role played by "society" in relation to government. "Society" is that in the name of which government strives to limit itself, but it is also the target for permanent governmental intervention to produce, multiply, and guarantee the freedoms required by economic liberalism. Far from being opposed to the State, civil society is thus shown to be the correlate of a liberal technology of government."--BOOK JACKET.},

What, he asks, did these men, often on the high seas for years at a time, do for sexual fulfillment? Buccaneer sexuality differed widely from that of other all- male institutions such as prisons, for it existed not within a regimented structure of rule, regulations, and oppressive supervision, but instead operated in a society in which widespread toleration of homosexuality was the norm and conditions encouraged its practice. In his new introduction, Burg discusses the initial response to the book when it was published in 1983 and how our perspectives on all-male societies have since changed.},

Considering two dominant models of sexuality, identity and lifestyle, I argue that BDSM is more fluid and less binary than identity. Moreover, while lifestyle focusses attention on BDSM as consumptive labour, this model does not adequately address the pleasure or sociality BDSM practitioners themselves emphasize. Instead, I argue that "working at play" recognizes the ways that practitioners move between registers of work (productive labour) and play (creative recombination). This analysis situates BDSM (and other sexualities) within the shifting cultural geography of U.S. late-modernity, drawing attention to the ways sexuality blurs boundaries between individual—social, real—pretend and leisure—labour. /// Cet article soutient que la pratique sexuelle du BDSM [bondage, domination/soumission, sadomasochisme] devrait être conçue comme une façon de travailler en jouant. En prenant en compte deux interprétations dominantes de la sexualité, l'identité et le mode de vie, je soutiens que la pratique du BDSM est plus changeante et moins binaire que ne le suppose une conception identitaire de la sexualité. De plus, si le fait de concevoir la sexualité comme un mode de vie focalise l'attention sur le BDSM en tant que travail de consommation, ce modèle n'aborde cependant pas adéquatement les questions du plaisir et de la sociabilité auxquelles les adeptes du BDSM accordent eux-mêmes de l'importance. Je soutiens que penser le BDSM comme une manière de travailler en jouant tient compte des façons dont les adeptes naviguent entre les registres du travail (travail de production) et du jeu (recombinaison créative), travaillant ainsi à l'interface des catégories suivantes: individuel—social, réel—simulé et loisir—travail. Cette analyse situe le BDSM (et d'autres types de sexualité millénaire) dans le cadre de la géographie culturelle changeante des États-Unis en période de modernité avancée.},

Here, I also discuss emerging lines of scholarship that focus on the ways in which privileges (particularly race/ethnicity and class) shape identification with and access to BDSM communities. Third, I discuss work on BDSM communities, examining the ways that community organization shapes BDSM experiences. I conclude with suggestions for future research in the field including deepening and broadening intersectional analyses of BDSM experiences, exploring specialized roles and identities that exist within the broader BDSM umbrella, and investigating similarities and differences between those who participate in BDSM on a time-limited basis versus those for whom BDSM is an ongoing, continual core aspect of identity.},

Tattooing can call into question concepts of volition in reference to the power to inscribe and define one's subjectivity through one's own skin, and the social defining of the subject. Skin is the involution or event between subject and object, will and cultural inscription, the social and the self. Feminists, particularly corporeal feminists, have attempted to think ways in which the female flesh may be recognized and self-defined without risking essentialism through reification of the meaning of ?woman's body?. Thinking a tattooed female body thus resonates with some of the risks and benefits feminism has found in theorizing a marginalized body. Using Deleuze, Guattari, Lyotard and other major influences on corporeal feminists, this article explores ways in which significance is sought in skin, and possible configurations of skin and world, which challenge the desire to read the flesh as a legible incarnation of subjectivity.},

	abstract = {In this article, I focus on the media's framing of non-mainstream body modification as a social problem. I demonstrate, through an analysis of a sample of 35 newspaper articles on body modification, that a mutilation discourse is one of the dominant frames of meaning used to make sense of body modifiers in the mainstream media. This framing, which effects the pathologization of body modifiers, utilizes the claims making of mental-health experts and relies on a gendered account of body modification as a social problem. While news accounts are a medium for presenting body modification to a large `community of speakers', I find that they have precluded the legitimacy of the claims of subcultural actors. I argue from a poststructuralist perspective that body modifiers' `claims from the underside' are subjugated by accounts that problematize body modification through the dominant discourse of the mental-health model. I suggest that this frame is problematic for its silencing of `underside' or marginal embodied knowledges, which include, for example, alternative accounts of female embodiment.},

The paper will explore sensory and other shifts used to produce what one informant called 'that transformative experience.' It is posited that 'dominance/ submission' and 'top/bottom' are not simply asymmetrical relations in terms of power relations, but that they evoke fundamentally different states of consciousness. Further, altered states in consensual bondage and fetish play differ significantly in hetero- and homosexual play. The reasons for this appear to have both historical and political implications which are explored briefly in the paper.},

Research on emotion and pain has burgeoned. We review the last decade’s literature, focusing on links between emotional processes and persistent pain.

Results
Neurobiological research documents the neural processes that distinguish affective from sensory pain dimensions, link emotion and pain, and generate central nervous system pain sensitization. Psychological research demonstrates that greater pain is related to emotional stress and limited emotional awareness, expression, and processing. Social research shows the potential importance of emotional communication, empathy, attachment, and rejection.

Conclusions
Emotions are integral to the conceptualization, assessment, and treatment of persistent pain. Research should clarify when to eliminate or attenuate negative emotions, and when to access, experience, and express them. Theory and practice should integrate emotion into cognitive-behavioral models of persistent pain.},

	abstract = {Drawing from extensive insider ethnographic work and an internet survey with a convenience sample of 1642 BDSM practitioners, I show that the social context of the BDSM subculture has a profound impact on pansexual BDSM practitioners’ interpretation of the relationship between BDSM and sex. Greater involvement in the public BDSM subculture and participation in feminine Dominance/masculine submission are both strongly associated with less preference for and experience of sexual BDSM. Greater involvement in the BDSM subculture increases participants’ likelihood of viewing their sexuality in terms of BDSM but decreases their likelihood of viewing BDSM in sexual terms. BDSM practitioners who meet new BDSM partners in BDSM subcultural contexts, even ones where sex is allowed, are much less likely to have sex with their partners than practitioners who met anywhere else. I argue that research should focus more on the social factors that influence participants’ experience and interpretation of BDSM, particularly on the influence of the BDSM subculture, and that theorists should think more broadly about the social determinants of “sex” and “sexual experience.”},

	abstract = {The aim of this chapter is to analyse ‘BDSM,’ an acronym for ‘Bondage, Domination (or Discipline), and Sado-Masochism.’ This is a group of practices which bind together physical pain and sexual pleasure. It is a specific way to experience eroticism and sexualities. BDSM is also part of a deeper personal and social identity construction. Identities are moving processes which come true through practices, including sexual ones. In this specific case, eroticism can be connected to pain or intense body stimulation during BDSM rituals. Generally, in contemporary society and its mainstream representations, pain and pleasure are opposites. Nonetheless, there are sexual research projects which are deeply involved in pain experimentation. For example, a slap, during negotiated sexual play, can be fundamental for a meaningful relation between subjectivities. It can also be part of the way a singular person gets in touch with the world within him/herself and the world of meanings and symbols the contest is made of. Playing BDSM is a form of personal and negotiated agency produced by an embodiment of representations and meanings which can be reconsidered and lived in an intimate human exchange. Pain does not have to be overcome; it can be expressed through bodies which are objects of many choices. Pain can be understood, managed, and lived. Consensual sado-masochism plays with and calls into question our rational ways to experiencing pain. Does pain always have to be sedated when it is not necessary and useful? Can physical pain during a sex play be useful to understand the potential of personal and socialized agency? Whiplashes, hot wax dripping, and bodies tied in uncomfortable but charming positions are ways to embody specific contextual influences – but also ways to produce meanings and to act on and through bodies living in the world.},

	abstract = {Flesh hooking is the act of suspending the human body from hooks pierced through the skin and flesh of the body. Two primary characteristics of flesh hook suspension stand out as being of particular interest: it is seen, meaning it is performed in various contexts (performance, play, ritual) as some kind of spectacle, and it is done, meaning the physical act is performed and not faked as a product of illusion. In spite of both these concrete aspects of flesh hooking, it is a physical act with illusory implications. Although it has a rich cultural history, flesh hooking seems to exemplify the postmodern, with shifting meanings or, as cultural theorist Peggy Phelan says, ‘extremely up-in-the-air…impossible to map.’ In contemporary cultural logic, the symbols of performance, including the body and its response to pain, are slippery, and few meanings are fixed. In this chapter I posit that flesh hook suspension is an apt metaphor for the coexistence of seemingly contradictory impulses, which I attempt to ‘map’ here. The various cultural and historical instances of flesh hooking can be considered through Richard Schechner’s theories of performances and Victor Turner’s liminality and communitas construct. The concept of communitas is useful in understanding ceremonies that include flesh hooking performed by the Mandan and Oglala/Lakota Sioux peoples of North America and the Tamil Hindu kavadi ritual, as well acts of performance art and fetish performance. Witnessing pain in a performance context disorients the conventional spectator/performer relationship, lays bare the invisible contracts of participation, and reflects on the current social order. Owing to the inscrutability and uncertainty of the pain experience, pain in performance problematises the audience’s position and makes an ethical demand of witnesses. Through the dynamic experience of witnessing pain, the possibility for unexpected shared catharsis becomes attainable. While flesh hooking and Aristotle’s concept of catharsis are both ancient, the contemporary use of flesh hook suspension in performance achieves catharsis through means that are quintessentially postmodern and resistant to categorisation.},

The template analysis method was used to analyse the data. Findings illustrated that various non-erotic and non-sexual aspects of BDSM are important to practitioners.

	abstract = {The modern notion of sexuality took shape at the end of the nineteenth century, especially in the works of Richard von Krafft-Ebing and Albert Moll. This modernisation of sexuality was closely linked to the recognition of sexual diversity, as it was articulated in the medical–psychiatric understanding of what, at that time, was labelled as perversion. From around 1870, psychiatrists shifted the focus from immoral acts, a temporary deviation of the norm, to an innate morbid condition. In the late nineteenth century, several psychiatrists, collecting and publishing more and more case histories, classified and explained the wide range of deviant sexual behaviours they traced. The emergence of medical sexology meant that perversions could be diagnosed and discussed. Against this background both Krafft-Ebing and Moll articulated a new perspective, not only on perversion, but also on sexuality in general. Krafft-Ebing initiated and Moll elaborated a shift from a psychiatric perspective in which deviant sexuality was explained as a derived, episodic and more or less singular symptom of a more fundamental mental disorder, to a consideration of perversion as an integral part of a more general, autonomous and continuous sexual instinct. Before Sigmund Freud and others had expressed similar views, it was primarily through the writings of Krafft-Ebing and Moll that a new understanding of human sexuality emerged.},

Having examined the background to the subject, I then explore how this volume makes three main contributions towards the ongoing embodiment of the discipline. The chapters that follow explicate and build sociologically upon the legacy of sociological, feminist and anthropological approaches towards embodiment. They also apply these approaches to issues such as conflict, health, cultural differences and technology that have become increasingly important in contemporary society. Finally, they demonstrate the empirical utility of taking embodiment seriously via a series of case-studies that focus on body pedagogics. In so doing, they outline a new approach towards the body, able to combine a concern with social power, cultural (re)production, lived experience and physical change.},

To understand environmentally responsible behavior, scholarship must acknowledge that humans are reflexively engaged with the material world, and engaging in alternative practices means engaging in alternative bodily habits, routines, and rituals.

It starts by placing this increased recognition of the body in its historical and social context. It then examines, in turn, how the body is viewed in the phenomenology of Merleau-Ponty; practice theory; embodied cognition; and sensory studies. Existing and potential influences in information studies are discussed. Most work that reexamines the place of the body reflects the influence of Merleau-Ponty, but he has had relatively little direct impact on IS. Practice theory does deal with the body, and this has already been picked up quite strongly in IS. Work in the area of embodied cognition has the potential to fundamentally change our view of the relation of the mind and the body, and information as an aspect of that relation. Sensory studies offers a powerful framework for examining the cultural shaping of the senses as a source of information. The implications of the bodily turn for methodology are briefly discussed.},

	abstract = {Contemporary research into the field of body pedagogics has produced a growing number of studies concerned with the embodied character of cultural transmission, experience, reproduction and change. This article advances this sociological development by reinterpreting recent writings on situated epistemic relations (SER) and practical epistemological analysis (PEA) as complementary, methodological, techniques that can enhance these investigations. After outlining existing explorations into the body pedagogics of occupational, sporting, religious, educational and other cultures, the author demonstrates how the interlinked approaches to learning made possible by systematizing SER and PEA can be developed into a new approach that increases the effectiveness with which the theoretical and empirical concerns of studies into embodied acculturation are harnessed.},

	abstract = {In this chapter I reflect upon the importance of Marcel Mauss’ concept of ‘body techniques’ for facilitating an empirical analysis of embodiment. I begin by arguing that sociology is not guilty of mind/body dualism, in the philosophical sense, but tends rather to take the embodiment of actions and practices for granted and thus to overlook it, much as Leder suggests happens more generally in everyday, lay experience. It is the purpose, knowledge-base and normativity of actions and practices that has tended to be thematized in sociology, I observe. The importance of Mauss’ concept, I continue, is that it thematizes embodiment, simultaneously drawing attention to the socio-cultural variability of particular ways of acting, without losing sight of purpose, knowledge or normativity. Indeed it draws all of these aspects of action together. Having made these points in an abstract manner, the chapter attempts to show how this innovation can and has shaped empirical work in social science. An empirical focus upon body techniques, I suggest, facilitates an empirical engagement with the embodiment of the social world.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we explore some of the tensions involved in the process of engaging with embodiment research. Although a significant volume of discursive work on “the body” and its role in social relations now exists, there is little in the way of empirical research that moves the focus away from discourse alone to concentrate on other modalities, such as embodied feelings, sensations, and engagements with the world. We begin by briefly reviewing the turn to embodiment across the social sciences and the manner in which this has been taken up in psychology. We then outline our attempts as a research collective to develop methodologies and research activities that can produce meaningful data on embodied experience. The outcomes of one of these tasks are then described in detail, along with reflections on the difficulties and limitations that emerged. Finally, we attempt to conceptualize the challenge of researching embodiment by returning to the late 19th century psychology of John Dewey, which, we argue, neatly summarizes some of the problems to be addressed by any researchers engaged in the “turn to the body.”},

No studies on body modifications and core-symptoms of ADHD are available.ObjectivesThis study aimed to compare self-reported ADHD symptoms between non-clinical adults with and without body modifications.MethodsA non-clinical adult Swedish population (n=815) completed the Adult ADHD self-report scale (ASRS-v1.1) and answered questions concerning body modification. ADHD diagnosis served as exclusion criterion. Three grouping variables were analysed separately; tattoo status, piercing status and a combination of having both tattoo and piercing. Linear regression compared mean ASRS total- and subscale scores between individuals with and without body modification according to each grouping variable, while adjusting for candidate covariates age and sex.ResultsThe prevalence of each body modification variable was; 30\% for tattoo, 18\% for piercing other than earlobe and 12\% for combination of tattoo and piercing. Any combination of body modification was associated with significantly higher ASRS total- and subscale scores compared to no body modification. The most pronounced differences between groups were for the combination of tattoo and piercing, and on the hyperactivity/impulsivity (HI) subscale; revealing adjusted mean differences of 4.3 points (range 0-72) on the ASRS-total score (p {\textless}0.001) and 2.6 points (range 0-36) on the ASRS HI subscale (p {\textless}0.001).ConclusionsBody modification was associated with more pronounced ADHD core symptoms amongst non-clinical adults. Although statistically significant, the clinical significance is uncertain. The prevalence rates of body modifications in our cohort indicate that they are becoming cultural normal.DisclosureNo significant relationships.},

In fact, as this fascinating book shows, body mods have been on the scene since ancient times, traceable as far back as 1.5 million years, and they also encompass sacrification, branding, and implants. Professor John Rush outlines the processes and procedures of these radical physical alterations, showing their function as rites of passage, group identifiers, and mechanisms of social control. He explores the use of pain for spiritual purposes, such as purging sin and guilt, and examines the phenomenon of accidental cuts and punctures as individual events with sometimes profound implications for group survival. Spiritual Tattoo finds a remarkable consistency in body modifications from prehistory to the present, suggesting the importance of the body as a sacred geography from both social and psychological points of view.},

	abstract = {Prior research indicates that motivations for obtaining tattoos are generally to signify philosophical positions, identity formation, life transitions and group membership. However, questions remain around the generalizability of these motivations for special populations. The current study advances the extant literature by qualitatively examining a group of self-identified survivors of sexual violence and their motivations for obtaining tattoos. Results of our study indicate that survivors of sexual violence seek out tattoo as a non-traditional form of healing. Survivors sought out tattoos as a means of regaining control of their bodies and their environment, reclamation and anti-normative healing and deviance from the patriarchy.},

It frames the popularity of tattooing in the Western World, in relation to other modern body modifications and within the landscape of consumer culture. Showing parallels between the motivations and meanings of contemporary tattoo practices, a historical overview of tattoos in premodern and non-Western cultures is presented. The divergent ways in which scholars have approached tattooing is examined, juxtaposing research in the behavioral sciences that links tattoos to deviant and antisocial behaviors with ethnographic and social–scientific studies that place tattoos within cultural, symbolic, esthetic, and prosocial frameworks.},

	abstract = {Research with individuals who practice consensual Bondage, Discipline, Domination, Submission, Sadism, and Masochism (BDSM) has shed light on a complex and multi-faceted phenomenon. How much this experience relates to sexuality and sexual pleasure is a controversial topic in the literature. This review offers a critical re-conceptualization of the sexual component, comparing BDSM and non-BDSM sexual experiences, and highlighting the importance of the erotic construction of power as a source of pleasure. It also discusses whether the erotic power exchange experience (EPE) reveals a sexual or an erotic orientation. The variety of terms and acronyms used to designate the experience of eroticization of power (BDSM, EPE, S\&M sadism and masochism, D/S or sadomasochism, Fetish, kink and kinky sex) reflects the many perspectives that have been taken in observing the phenomenon. Generalizing BDSM as an eminently sexual experience has obscured a more nuanced understanding of the specific meanings relating to the activities promoted by the communities and simplified a variegated geography of experiences. These experiences are difficult to summarize in terms of typifications and can be better described as “finite provinces of meanings”. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)},

Participants in the “Dance of Souls”, a 3.5-hour event during which participants received temporary piercings with hooks or weights attached to the piercings and danced to music provided by drummers, responded to measures of two altered states of consciousness. Participants also completed measures of positive and negative affect, salivary cortisol (a hormone associated with stress), self-reported stress, sexual arousal, and intimacy. Both pierced participants (pierced dancers) and non-pierced participants (piercers, piercing assistants, observers, drummers, and event leaders) showed evidence of altered states aligned with transient hypofrontality (Dietrich, 2003; measured with a Stroop test) and flow (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990; Csikszentmihalyi \& Csikszentmihalyi, 1990; measured with the Flow State Scale). Both pierced and non-pierced participants also reported decreases in negative affect and psychological stress and increases in intimacy from before to after the ritual. Pierced and non-pierced participants showed different physiological reactions, however, with pierced participants showing increases in cortisol and non-pierced participants showing decreases from before to during the ritual. Overall, the ritual appeared to induce different physiological effects but similar psychological effects in focal ritual participants (i.e., pierced dancers) and in participants adopting other roles.},

This phenomenon includes individuals as well as organized and documented projects held in public spaces. The topic of body modification through tattoos has benefited from an explosion in academic interest; however, there has been little scholarly attention directed at examining how tattoo practices may be understood as a means of coping with trauma within a contemporary cultural context. While drawing on psychological and cultural studies’ perspectives we explored the meanings attributed to tattoos by trauma survivors. Analyzing documented personal accounts of tattooed survivors in different countries, we illustrated how being tattooed appears to be a personal way of coping with trauma as well as a cultural practice of meaning making. The meanings attributed by trauma survivors’ included: exposing their trauma for recognition, witnessing, meaningfulness of the tattoo, connection, control, and transformation. The meaning-making process appears to be continuous and dynamic, shaped by psychological responses, social interactions, and cultural narratives.},

However, cancer survivor tattoos are one of many strategies used to recover from the trauma of cancer diagnosis and treatment. In this study, we seek to understand the significance of these tattoos in the context of survivorship. We interviewed 19 cancer survivors about their survivor tattoos, exploring the benefits of designing, discussing, and displaying these tattoos as elements of emotional recovery post-cancer. We found that the act of designing a survivor tattoo facilitated all three elements of post-traumatic growth processes, including: (1) changed self-perception; (2) changed sense of relationships with others; and (3) changed philosophy of life. Through participants' lived experiences, we discuss information about emotions, health, and recovery encoded in tattoos, and provide implications for tools to help future cancer survivors recover from the trauma of diagnosis and treatment.},
